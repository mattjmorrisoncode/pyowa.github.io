### Our Topic: Review of the basic features of OpenCV
Join us for a review of the basic features of OpenCV.  This is the groundwork for more complex computer vision features in OpenCV.  We'll be starting at the bit level for image generation, reviewing image manipulation by channel (RGB) and higher level "basic" options like contrast changes, masks and more.


#### Presenter Bio
Zac Crane has dabbled in Python for a few years now and is currently working through the OpenCV course for Computer Vision to explore the capabilities of image and video manipulation and analysis in Python while expanding his base of coding knowledge.
