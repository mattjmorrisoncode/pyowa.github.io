### Our Topic: HTTP Caching in Python

This talk will be about how to make your python application as smart as your browser with client-side HTTP caching. The audience for this is anyone who uses a python HTTP client like requests, aiohttp, etc. We will talk about how HTTP caching works in general, and libraries and techniques to make use of it in python.
